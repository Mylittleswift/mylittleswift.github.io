[Vital Monitor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/multi-vital-monitor/id1445374809#?platform=iphone)<br /> (FDA Cleared)
---------------------------------------------
This app is designed to allow clinical researchers and VivaLNK Mobile SDK Developers to capture a continuous stream of patient vitals and biometrics using the VivaLNK wearable sensors (i.e. ECG patch, TEMP patch, SpO2 monitor, BP cuff). The data can either be integrated directly into the clinical application or downloaded for retrospective analysis. The types of data that can be captured include ECG, heart rate, respiratory rate, 3-axis accelerometer, temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure.<br />
