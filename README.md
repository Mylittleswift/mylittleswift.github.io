FeverSense is a wearable thermometer that continuously keeps track of your child’s temperature when they’re sick. The flexible, comfortable monitor is positioned in your child’s armpit and wirelessly sends accurate, real-time temperature readings to your smart device. With a single charge, you can track your child’s temperature for up to 7 days. If your child’s temperature rises, the connected FeverSense app will alert you, so you can respond immediately.<br />
